# ü§ù Auto Approver Join Request Bot

## üìñ Overview
The **Auto Approver Join Request Bot** is a Telegram bot built with Pyrogram to automate the approval of join requests for Telegram groups and channels. It instantly approves users who request to join, saving admins time and effort. Upon approval, the bot sends a personalized welcome message to the user via private chat, including links to related channels for further engagement. The bot also provides a simple `/start` command for users to interact with it directly.

This bot is ideal for Telegram group or channel admins who want to streamline the onboarding process while promoting their community or related content.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to deploy the bot on your own server or local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Pyrogram library (`pip install pyrogram`)
- Telegram API credentials:
  - **API ID** and **API Hash** from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)
  - **Bot Token** from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZenSlashBS/Auto-acceptor-
   cd Auto-acceptor-
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyrogram
   ```

3. **Configure Credentials**:
   - Open the bot script (e.g., `bot.py`).
   - Replace the placeholder values for `BOT_TOKEN`, `API_ID`, and `API_HASH` with your own:
     ```python
     environ["BOT_TOKEN"] = "your-bot-token"
     environ["API_ID"] = "your-api-id"
     environ["API_HASH"] = "your-api-hash"
     ```

4. **Customize Links (Optional)**:
   - Update the inline button URLs in the welcome message to point to your desired Telegram channels or links.
   - Modify the greeting text in the `auto_approve` function if needed.

5. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

6. **Add to Group/Channel**:
   - Add the bot to your Telegram group or channel via the ‚ÄúAdd Me In Chat‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdd Me In Channel‚Äù buttons.
   - Grant it admin rights to approve join requests.

## üìÇ Code Overview
- **Framework**: Pyrogram, an async Python library for Telegram bots.
- **Key Handlers**:
  - `on_message`: Handles the `/start` command in private chats.
  - `on_chat_join_request`: Processes join requests for groups/channels.
- **Environment Variables**: Uses `os.environ` to store bot token and API credentials.
- **Inline Buttons**: Created with `InlineKeyboardButton` and `InlineKeyboardMarkup` for interactive menus.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- **No Persistent Storage**: Join request logs are printed to the console and not saved.
- **Single Language**: Welcome messages are in English only.
- **Manual Configuration**: API credentials and links must be hardcoded in the script.
- **No Error Handling**: Basic implementation without robust error management for failed approvals or messages.

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- Add database support for logging join requests and user data.
- Implement multi-language support for welcome messages.
- Add admin commands to manage bot settings (e.g., toggle auto-approval).
- Include error handling for failed API calls or invalid links.
- Support custom welcome message templates via admin input.
- Add rate-limiting to prevent abuse.
